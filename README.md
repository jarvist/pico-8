# Frost Pico-8 Games

Back in December 2022, I bought a copy of
[Pico-8](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php) : an 8-bit fantasy console
running Lua and with a nice integrated development environment (sprite editor).

I've slowly slowly been writing games with my children since then: generally
they make the art and have a very clear direction of what they want me to code. 

## Games

### [Submarine Racer](2025-11-submarineracer.html)

You are the submarine. The little sibling submarine will follow you about. 
The Mothership submarine bumbles back and forwards. The crab robot crawls on
the seabed, and fires a seeking missile at you.
