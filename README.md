# Frost Pico-8 Games

Back in December 2022, I bought a copy of Pico-8 : an 8-bit fantasy console
running Lua and with a nice integrated development environment (sprite editor).

I've slowly slowly been writing games with my children since then: generally
they make the art and have a very clear direction of what they want me to code.
